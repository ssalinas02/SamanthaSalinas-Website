        My name is Samantha Salinas and I am currently a freshman at UC Riverside. While I am undeclared on my major, Iâ€™m leaning towards something within the Social Sciences department. I do plan to minor in business with the hopes of having a couple businesses of my own, maybe to open up my own local coffee shop or a chain shelter for homeless people. From past classes I have been enrolled in, I have fair experience with Adobe Photoshop,  Lightroom, and InDesign, along with Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. I thoroughly enjoy learning about humans and how society functions. For this reason, I have taken part in actively volunteering specifically with children at the Ronald McDonald House in Palo Alto. I had the opportunity to learn about children at different ages and interact with them, not to mention those who were in treatment for serious medical conditions. Iâ€™ve gained the best experience possible there, as I was confronted with really difficult realities families from across the country face and how to respond appropriately to those situations. <br>
        Aside from volunteering, I also have exceptional problem solving, team work, leadership, and customer service skills since I worked in the food service industry at one of Stanford Universityâ€™s dining halls. I would definitely call myself a very lenient employee, to the point where the managers would recommend my coworkers ask me to fill in for them when they werenâ€™t able to attend their shifts. I am also a very dedicated worker; during school, I wouldnâ€™t have much time to get involved with sports or clubs because I would be working 30-35 hours a week over the course of five days, with one day dedicated to regular volunteering, and my last day primarily for school work. Developing strong relationships is very important to me in any environment, professional or casual. It makes whatever Iâ€™m doing more enjoyable but also it makes it a lot easier to work with people you know well enough and the most effective ways to communicate with them.<br>
        When Iâ€™m not working or volunteering, I find myself looking for a new adventure to go on with my friends and family. Being from the Bay Area, I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to be in what is known as the â€œMelting Pot'' in almost all aspects imaginable. There is always a new place to explore and submerge myself into. As fascinating as it is to learn about the world, I also love to put myself into situations where Iâ€™m able to learn more about myself. If I had to pick a life goal for myself, it would definitely be skydiving; Itâ€™s seeing the world from a whole different point of view, in a fun and thrilling way. What I seek to find during my life is also what I want to give others. I want everyone to have the same opportunities I do, if not better. There are so many people out there who are severely disadvantaged in regards to the most basic necessities of life and itâ€™s not fair. I aspire to contribute to making a difference in these peoplesâ€™ lives. <br>
